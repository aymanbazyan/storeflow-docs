Go to `./web/lang/lang.json` and edit any string you want to show in the website (e.g., change `"Sets"` to `"Builds"`)

Or re-write everything in another language !

And you can also change the direction of the website if you want to use Arabic or Hebrew language.

`lang.json:`

```javascript
{
    "ln": "ar",
    "rtl": true,
  "messages": {
    "misc": {
      "printOrder": "طباعة الطلب",
      "storageUsage": "استخدام التخزين",
      "usedLabel": "مستخدم"
    },
    "notifications": {
      "newOrder": {...
```
