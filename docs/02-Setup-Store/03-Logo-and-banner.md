# Logo and banner

---

### Website's icon

Go to `./public/` and change the `icon.png`. (for fav + header)
Go to `./public/` and change the `icon-2.png`. (for footer - dark background)

And for different sizes and devices, upload your icon to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/), download the ZIP file, uncompress it, move all the icons to the `/public` folder too.

### Website's banner (optional)

You can also always change the banner dynamically from admin panel in the `/admin?tab=Theme`.
