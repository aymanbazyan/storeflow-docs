# Getting Started

Let's discover **Storeflow in less than 5 minutes**.

## Basic setup

Get started by **opening any code editor**.

Or **download VS Code** from **[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.18.3 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to download the project.

## Get the project template

Download the project folder using **git**.

The package will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
# Currently unavailable
git clone https://github.com/aymanbazyan/storeflow.git
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

This command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Storeflow.

```bash
cd ./web
```
